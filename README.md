## Introduction

TechNest is a platform that works with AI where users can read, write, and interact with articles on various technology topics. Users can personalize their feed based on topics they follow, also they can write their own articles or share outsourced ones! 

**During adding the article our AI model can predict the most relevant topic for that article based on the content**
